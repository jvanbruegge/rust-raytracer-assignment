# rust-raytracer-assignment
This will be a raytracer written with Rust and Vulkan

I am doing this as my coding assignment for the computer graphics course and because I want to go deeper into Vulkan and Rust

## Build the binary

You need `cargo` and `rustc` installed, using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) is the easiest for this.

Then simply run `cargo build` to compile a binary or `cargo run` to build and execute

## Progress

I will update this section with more images

Currently this raytracer looks like this:

### Changing color based on window width
